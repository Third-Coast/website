Competitions are divided into years individually, and these are attached to one of the main two competitions via an edge labeled *edition* (see associations below). Competitions (as well as happenings) keep track of time, and can organize themselves in that regard. Because of this, they can appear in a preview state, which shows a template that is very informational in nature, and once their *archive date* has been surpassed, the template switches again to something resembling playlist. Templates will automatically organize winners and participants as necessary when switching modes.',

The annual representation of each competition needs only ONE parent edition, which is the competition it is a part of.
